# Basic-calculator
## Project Title
**Basic Calculator**

## Project Description
This is a simple **Basic Calculator** application built using C++. The program allows the user to perform four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input two numbers and choose the desired operation, and the program will output the result. It also handles division by zero errors gracefully.

The calculator supports:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)

This program demonstrates basic C++ functionality, including user input, conditional statements, loops, and basic mathematical operations.

## Project Vision
The vision for this project is to:

- Provide a simple, functional calculator for performing basic arithmetic operations.
- Serve as an educational tool to demonstrate how to handle user input and mathematical calculations in C++.
- Be easily extendable to include more advanced features such as scientific functions or a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Encourage beginners to learn C++ programming and practice basic coding concepts like conditionals and loops.

## Key Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- **Input Validation:** Handles user input to ensure the correct choice of operation and numbers.
- **Error Handling:** Properly handles errors like division by zero, providing informative error messages.
- **Interactive Console Interface:** Provides a simple and intuitive command-line interface to interact with the user.
- **Easy to Extend:** The current code can be easily expanded to include additional features like scientific operations, memory functions, or even a graphical interface in the future.
